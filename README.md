## 🎮 Interactive Demos

### DVD Bouncer
Physics-based simulation with collision detection and color-changing effects.

### Breakout Game
Classic arcade game implementation with TypeScript, featuring:
- Paddle and ball mechanics
- Brick destruction with scoring
- Real-time collision detection

### Emergence Engine
Cellular automata visualization supporting:
- Conway's Game of Life
- Rule 30 and other elementary CAs
- Custom pattern loading
- Real-time rule modification

### Duck Konundrum
Recreation of an MIT Mystery Hunt puzzle demonstrating:
- Constraint solving algorithms
- Step-by-step puzzle progression
- Interactive logical reasoning

## 🚀 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Create production build
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Development Guidelines

- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Optimize performance with efficient rendering
- Write semantic, accessible HTML

## 📱 Responsive Design

The portfolio is built mobile-first with breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 992px
- Desktop: > 992px

## 🎨 Design System

Based on Material Design 3 principles with custom enhancements:
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Accessible color contrast
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Modern UI components

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Hosting

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [{"source": "**", "destination": "/index.html"}]
  }
}
```

### Vite Configuration

Optimized for React development with fast refresh and efficient bundling.

## 📈 Performance

- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Efficient state management
- Canvas-based animations for smooth performance

## 🧪 Testing

Currently using manual testing. Future enhancements may include:
