# Project Coordination Status
*Generated by Project Coordination Specialist*

## Current Project Assessment (Phase 0)

### Baseline Measurements
- **Bundle Size**: 474.49 KB JavaScript + 367.53 KB CSS (842 KB total)
- **Target Bundle Size**: <500KB initial load (need 342 KB reduction)
- **Current TypeScript Coverage**: ~15% (1 file: Breakout.tsx)
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (no testing framework)
- **Zustand Integration**: ✅ Already installed and basic setup exists
- **PWA Plugins**: ✅ Dependencies available (vite-plugin-pwa, rollup-plugin-visualizer)

### Architecture Assessment
```
Current State: B+ (Well-structured foundation)
├── Modern React 18 ✅
├── Zustand State Management ✅ (installed, basic usage)
├── Design System ✅ (comprehensive design-system/ folder)
├── Component Architecture ✅ (good separation of concerns)
├── Interactive Simulations ✅ (sophisticated implementations)
├── Bundle Optimization ⚠️ (basic Vite config, needs enhancement)
├── TypeScript Migration ⚠️ (15% coverage)
├── Testing Framework ❌ (missing)
├── Performance Monitoring ❌ (missing)
└── Accessibility Compliance ⚠️ (needs audit)
```

### Phase Dependencies Analysis
- **Phase 1 Ready**: ✅ Can begin immediately (Foundation & Performance)
- **Phase 2 Dependencies**: Phase 1 build optimization completion
- **Phase 3 Dependencies**: Phases 1-2 (modern architecture builds on performance)
- **Phase 4 Dependencies**: Phase 3 (TypeScript migration needs stable architecture)
- **Phase 5 Dependencies**: Phases 1-4 (monitoring needs complete foundation)
- **Phase 6 Dependencies**: All previous phases (advanced features)

## Implementation Coordination Strategy

### Memory System Structure
```
coordination/
├── phase-progress.json     # Real-time phase status tracking
├── agent-assignments.json  # Specialist agent task assignments
├── dependency-map.json     # Inter-phase dependency tracking
├── milestone-status.json   # Success criteria monitoring
└── communication-log.json  # Agent coordination history
```

### Agent Coordination Plan
1. **Foundation Specialist** → Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
2. **UX/Accessibility Specialist** → Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8) 
3. **Architecture Specialist** → Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)
4. **TypeScript/Testing Specialist** → Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16)
5. **Monitoring System Specialist** → Phase 5 (Weeks 17-20)
6. **Advanced Features Specialist** → Phase 6 (Weeks 21-24)

### Critical Path Identification
**Sequential Dependencies (Cannot be Parallelized):**
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Phase 5 & 6 can have some overlap (weeks 19-21)
- Documentation updates can occur parallel to implementation
- Testing can begin once architecture is stable (Phase 3+)

## Immediate Action Items

### Phase 1 Initialization (Critical Priority)
1. ✅ **Bundle Analysis**: Current size assessment complete
2. 🔄 **Vite Enhancement**: Update configuration for optimization
3. 📋 **Performance Baseline**: Establish Core Web Vitals measurements
4. 📋 **PWA Setup**: Initialize service worker capabilities

### Coordination Tasks
1. 🔄 **Memory System Setup**: Create coordination files
2. 📋 **Agent Communication**: Establish handoff protocols
3. 📋 **Progress Tracking**: Initialize milestone monitoring
4. 📋 **Dependency Mapping**: Create detailed task dependencies

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Performance Targets (Phase 1)
- [ ] Bundle size: 842KB → <500KB (342KB reduction needed)
- [ ] Lighthouse score: Unknown → >85
- [ ] LCP: Unknown → <2.5s
- [ ] FID: Unknown → <100ms
- [ ] CLS: Unknown → <0.1

### Quality Targets (Phases 2-4)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: Unknown → 100%
- [ ] TypeScript coverage: 15% → >70%
- [ ] Test coverage: 0% → >80%
- [ ] Mobile usability: Unknown → >95

### Advanced Targets (Phases 5-6)
- [ ] Monitoring agents: 0 → 5 operational
- [ ] Real-time dashboard: Missing → Functional
- [ ] PWA capabilities: Missing → Full implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Bundle Size Reduction**: May require significant refactoring
   - *Mitigation*: Gradual optimization with performance monitoring
2. **Performance Regression**: Changes may impact simulation performance
   - *Mitigation*: Continuous benchmarking during Phase 1
3. **Accessibility Compliance**: Complex simulations need special handling
   - *Mitigation*: Expert consultation and automated testing

### Coordination Risks
1. **Agent Handoff Delays**: Dependencies could create bottlenecks
   - *Mitigation*: Clear completion criteria and parallel preparation
2. **Scope Creep**: Advanced features might expand beyond timeline
   - *Mitigation*: Strict priority enforcement and phase gating

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Complete memory system setup
2. Initialize Phase 1 with Foundation Specialist
3. Establish baseline performance measurements
4. Create detailed task assignments

### This Week
1. Vite configuration enhancement
2. Bundle optimization implementation
3. Core Web Vitals monitoring setup
4. Phase 1 milestone tracking
